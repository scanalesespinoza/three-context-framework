## The Three Context Framework

**The Three Context Framework** is a set of principles for creating resilient cloud-native applications, focusing on:

1. **Self-Healing**: Recovery from internal and external faults.
2. **Remote Connection Self-Management**: Adaptive behavior for connecting and supervising external systems.
3. **Resource and Scaling Management**: Managing contention, rate limits, and graceful degradation.
